                            The LEGO Group
                            <sup>[5]</sup> is a Danish construction toy 
                            production company based in Billund, Denmark.
                            <sup>[6]</sup> It manufactures Lego-branded toys, 
                            consisting mostly of interlocking plastic bricks. 
                            The LEGO Group has also built several amusement 
                            parks around the world, each known as Legoland, and 
                            operates numerous retail stores.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The company was founded on August 10, 1932, by Ole 
                            Kirk Christiansen.
                            <sup>[7]</sup> The name Lego is derived from the 
                            Danish phrase leg godt, meaning “play well”. In the 
                            first half of 2015, The LEGO Group became the 
                            world’s largest toy company by revenue, with sales 
                            amounting to US$2.1 billion, surpassing Mattel, 
                            which had US$1.9 billion in sales.

                        <p>
                            The Lego company was founded in 1932 by Ole Kirk 
                            Christiansen, a carpenter whose primary business of 
                            producing household goods had suffered due to the 
                            Great Depression. Initially producing wooden toys, 
                            the company later developed a system of interlocking 
                            bricks. Manufacturing of plastic Lego bricks began 
                            in Denmark in 1947. After a fire in the woodworking
                            department, Ole’s son, Godtfred, decided to stop the 
                            production of wooden toys an solely focus on plastic 
                            products and the Lego system. He also built an 
                            airport in Billund to facilitate the sale of 
                            Lego toys around the world.

                            In North America, Samsonite managed the Lego brand 
                            from 1961 until 1972 (United States) and 1986 
                            (Canada).

                        <p>
                            The name “LEGO” is a contraction of the Danish 
                            words: “leg godt” (English: “play well”). However, 
                            the name also means in Latin either “I collect,” “I 
                            compose,” or “I read”. These additional meanings, 
                            the first two of which are very relevant, only made 
                            sense when the company started making plastic blocks 
                            with knobs (Lego blocks) so that they could 
                            be put together.

                <p>
                    The Lego Group has built eleven amusement parks around the 
                    world, each known as Legoland. Each park features 
                    large-scale Lego models of famous landmarks and miniature 
                    Lego models of famous cities, along with Lego-themed rides. 
                    The first Legoland park was built in Lego’s home town of 
                    Billund in Denmark. This was followed by Legoland Windsor in 
                    England, Legoland California in Carlsbad, US and Legoland 
                    Deutschland in Günzburg, Germany. In addition, Legoland 
                    Sierksdorf was opened in 1973 but soon closed in 1976.

                <p>
                    In July 2005, the Lego Group announced that it had reached a 
                    deal with private investment company the Blackstone Group to 
                    sell all four parks for €375 million to the Blackstone 
                    subsidiary Merlin Entertainments. Under the terms of the 
                    deal, the Lego Group would take a 30% share in Merlin 
                    Entertainments and positions on their board.
                    <sup>[25]</sup> The sale of 
                    the theme parks was part of a wider strategy to restructure 
                    the company to focus on the core business of toy products.

                    In 2010, Merlin Entertainments opened the first Legoland 
                    water park at the Legoland California site. On 15 October 
                    2011, Merlin Entertainments opened their first new Legoland 
                    park, Legoland Florida, in Winter Haven, Florida. It is the 
                    largest Legoland opened to date at 145 acres, and only one 
                    of the Legoland parks opened in the United States. The other 
                    Legoland (opened at a later date) water park was opened near 
                    the same location on 26 May 2012 after only four months of 
                    construction.

                    Merlin Entertainment opened their second new Legoland park 
                    in Nusajaya, Malaysia under the name Legoland Malaysia on 22 
                    September 2012.[26] It is the first Legoland in Asia and was 
                    quickly followed by another Lego-themed water park in the 
                    same area. The first Lego hotel has also opened near the 
                    site. People who stay in the hotel will also get tickets to 
                    the theme park and water park.
                    <sup>[27]</sup> The September 2016 they opened Legoland 
                    Dubai. In addition, they opened four new Legoland Discovery 
                    Centres, which take the Legoland concept and scale it down 
                    to suit a retail park environment.

                    in 2021.

                <p>
                    In June 2019, the Lego Group purchased the remaining shares 
                    in Merlin Entertainments which they did not own and 
                    privatised the company.
                    <sup>[28]</sup> This returned the operation of the Legoland 
                    parks to the control of the Lego Group.
